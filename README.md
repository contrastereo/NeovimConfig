# NeoVim Config

Hi! this is just a repo for my personal neovim config, 


# Installation
If you wanna install the repo, create a neovim folder in your ~/.config folder and just clone it by using 
> git clone git@github.com:contrastereo/3dStudies.git

# Usage
to use the code just run the next line in the command line
>nvim

and lazyvim and nvim should update the dependencies in the plugins folder

# Modding
in the lua folder you can find the login and settings files so you can update your setup and add or remove anything you need.
